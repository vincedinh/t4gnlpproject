# t4gnlpproject
This project was created by Vince Dinh and Zachary Judson at the UCSC Tech4good Lab (Spring 2021) to research & train a machine learning model to predict categories of web design related questions based on Stack Overflow searches using Doc2Vec to build features & a Logistic Regression classifier (through Python & gensim external library). 
It yields around a 70-80% accuracy rate as of June 2021.
